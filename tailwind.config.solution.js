```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/**/*.html'], // Added ./public/**/*.html  for HTML files, if applicable.
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-blue': '#3498db', // Example custom color
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
This corrected configuration includes `'./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'` to cover your Javascript and Typescript files.  It is crucial to ensure that your project's file structure matches the paths specified. If you have HTML templates in a `public` directory, it is also important to include that directory in the `content` array. Adjust the paths as needed to include all files where your Tailwind classes are being used.
