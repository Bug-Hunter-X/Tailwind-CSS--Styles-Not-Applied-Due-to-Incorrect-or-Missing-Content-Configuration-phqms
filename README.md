# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue: Missing or Incorrect Content

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS setups: the `content` property in the `tailwind.config.js` file is either missing or incorrectly configured. This prevents Tailwind from correctly processing your CSS classes, leading to styles not being applied.

## Problem

The `content` property in `tailwind.config.js` specifies where Tailwind should look for class names to generate the CSS. If this property is incorrect (or missing), Tailwind will not find your class names and will not generate the corresponding styles.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly configuring the `content` array to point to the directories and files containing your Tailwind CSS classes.  The provided `tailwind.config.solution.js` demonstrates this.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1.  Use the `tailwind.config.js` file as your Tailwind config file.
2.  Try to use Tailwind classes in your project.  You'll observe that the styles won't be applied.

## Steps to Solve the Problem

1. Replace `tailwind.config.js` with `tailwind.config.solution.js`.
2. Rerun your build process.  Tailwind should now process the styles correctly.
